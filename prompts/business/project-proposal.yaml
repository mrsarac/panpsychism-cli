  ## Proposal Structure

  ### 1. Executive Summary
  - One page max
  - Problem, solution, key benefits, ask
  - Written for C-level (no jargon)

  ### 2. Problem Statement
  - Current situation analysis
  - Pain points with data
  - Cost of inaction
  - Who is affected

  ### 3. Proposed Solution
  - What we'll build/do
  - Why this approach
  - Alternatives considered
  - Success criteria

  ### 4. Business Value
  - ROI calculation
  - Qualitative benefits
  - Strategic alignment
  - Quick wins vs long-term

  ### 5. Scope & Timeline
  - In scope / out of scope
  - Phases and milestones
  - Dependencies
  - Gantt chart or timeline visual

  ### 6. Resource Requirements
  - Team composition
  - Budget breakdown
  - Tools/infrastructure
  - External dependencies

  ### 7. Risk Analysis
  - Risk matrix (likelihood x impact)
  - Mitigation strategies
  - Contingency plans

  ### 8. Governance & Next Steps
  - Decision needed
  - Approval process

  ## Writing Guidelines
  - Lead with business value, not technical details
  - Use data and metrics wherever possible

      # Project Proposal: Microservices Architecture Migration

      **Version:** 1.0
      **Date:** January 9, 2026
      **Status:** Draft for Review

      ---

      ## Executive Summary

      Our current monolithic architecture is limiting our ability to scale, deploy frequently,
      and attract top engineering talent. We propose a phased migration to microservices over
      12 months, with an investment of $200,000 that will yield an estimated 340% ROI over 3 years.

      | Item | Detail |
      |------|--------|
      | **Problem** | Monolith bottleneck: 2-week deploy cycles, 40% slower feature delivery |
      | **Solution** | Phased microservices migration with strangler fig pattern |
      | **Investment** | $200,000 (Year 1) |
      | **ROI** | 340% over 3 years ($680k in efficiency gains) |
      | **Timeline** | 12 months (4 phases) |

      **Decision Requested:** Approve Q1 budget allocation and team formation

      ---

      ## 1. Problem Statement

      ### Current Situation
      Our 8-year-old monolithic application serves 50,000 daily users but has become
      increasingly difficult to maintain and extend.

      ### Pain Points
      - **Deployment Bottleneck:** 2-week release cycles due to monolith complexity (Impact: High)
      - **Scaling Limitations:** Cannot scale components independently (Impact: High)
      - **Developer Productivity:** 40% of time spent on merge conflicts and coordination (Impact: Medium)
      - **Talent Acquisition:** Lost 3 candidates who wanted modern stack (Impact: Medium)

      ### Cost of Inaction
      - Estimated $150k/year in lost productivity
      - Risk of 2-3 day outages affecting $500k revenue
      - Continued talent attrition

      ---

      ## 2. Proposed Solution

      ### Overview
      Incremental migration using the Strangler Fig pattern, extracting services starting
      with the highest-value, lowest-risk components.

      ### Migration Order
      1. **User Authentication** - Standalone, low coupling (Month 1-2)
      2. **Notification Service** - High change frequency (Month 3-4)
      3. **Payment Processing** - Business critical, well-defined (Month 5-7)
      4. **Product Catalog** - Performance bottleneck (Month 8-10)
      5. **Order Management** - Core, final phase (Month 10-12)

      ## 5. Resource Requirements

      ### Budget

      | Category | Amount | Notes |
      |----------|--------|-------|
      | Engineering (2 senior + 1 mid) | $120,000 | 12 months |
      | Infrastructure (K8s, CI/CD) | $40,000 | Cloud platform |
      | Training & Tools | $20,000 | Team upskilling |
      | Contingency (10%) | $20,000 | Risk buffer |

      **Total Investment:** $200,000
